    "Throughout this assignment, we will be exploring different changes to the proposed algorithm, and their impact in results. Thus, we are in need of a numerical criteria that will allow us to measure results. For this reason, we are going to use the metrics of neighbourhood preservation and trustworthiness. These measure how the projection preserves the neighborhoods present in the input space by ranking the k-nearest neighbors of each sample before and after projection. The implementation of this criteria is in `neighbourhood_preservation_trustworthiness.ipynb`."
