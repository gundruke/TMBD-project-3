Q1: Regarding SOM1, what numerical criteria would you use to measure an improvement in a
algorithm?

Q2: Write the SOM1A version, where you change the interpolation curve of the learning factor. Can you get an
improvement?

Q3: Write the version SOM1B, where you change the interpolation curve of the standard deviation. Can you get
improvement?

Q4: Write version SOM1C, where you change the normal distribution to another distribution. Can you get
improvement?

Q5*: Determine the mathematical condition that guarantees convergence of equation (3), on page 13 of slides
A06-TMBD.pdf.

Q6: As explained in class, the SOM implicitly uses the Euler integration method for the associated ODE associated. Determine the (global) error committed after N epochs.

Q7*: How could you modify the proposed SOM to use the second-order Runge-Kutta method? Were there any improvements? What kind of improvements would we be expecting?

Q8*: Determine the error made after N epochs in Q7.

Q9: How would you combine the answers to the previous questions to improve your algorithm, namely,
ensuring better separation of the variable crops in the original dataset?
